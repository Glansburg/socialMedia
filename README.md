# socialMedia

## Hello Welcome to the readMe. page.
The motivation behind this page was to make my own social media website from the backend web-devleopment side and test the routes on insomnia. I used mongoDB to create this non-relational no-sql project.
## What I learned
Through this project I learned:
* How to utilize mongoose
* How to use mongoDB
* difference between nosql and sql
* better ability to use insomnia for routes
* That time invested was time well spent and I learned a lot.
  
## Being new to web development I came across some issues you may see obvious such as:
* video is longer than it had to be and had difficulty keeping track of which route i ran
 ## Instalation
N/A

## Usage
video demonstration of insomnia routes.
